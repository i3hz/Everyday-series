# GeminiHashtagGenerator

## Project Description
The `GeminiHashtagGenerator` is a Python-based tool that uses Google's Gemini API to generate relevant and optimized hashtags for social media posts. It can create up to 10 relevant hashtags for a given post, considering both popular and niche tags. The tool also suggests relevant categories (e.g., food, travel, fitness) based on the content of the post. This is helpful for individuals or businesses looking to enhance their social media visibility by using the right hashtags.
